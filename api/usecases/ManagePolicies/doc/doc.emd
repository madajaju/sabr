## Data Prioritization

![Data Prioritization](./dataprioritizationpolicies.png)

Data Prioritization becomes a critical task in data management as all data is not created equal - some hold more
relevance or significance than others. Hence, it is essential to prioritize and classify data according to its value or
strategic importance to the system or the user.

The concept of 'pushing data management to the edge' refers to the decentralization of data management efforts. Instead
of central, monolithic servers, data is processed, stored, and managed closer to its source, i.e., at the edges of the
network. This approach is particularly beneficial in controlling data sprawl and preventing unmanageable expansion. Data
sprawl refers to the large, uncontrolled, and often complex distribution of data across various locations and formats.

Applying data prioritization policies across the Mesh, SABRs, Platforms, and SABR instances ensures consistent and
efficient data management. Through this process, data across disparate elements in the system is organized and processed
according to its priority and importance.

Data Prioritization mitigates the risks associated with data sprawl and unmanageable data expansion. By
providing a systematic way to push management to the edge and apply consistent policies across the system, it ensures
that key data is identified and prioritized, enhancing the overall system's efficiency and effectiveness.

## Data Synchronization Between Clouds

Data synchronization between clouds denotes the process of ensuring that data across different cloud platforms is in a
consistent state, even as the data continues to be updated and changed across different cloud environments.

Differential channels allow for sophisticated control over how and where data is moved, based upon the current
conditions of the Dynamic Data Integration Layer (DDIL) environment. The DDIL is the layer where the integration of data
across different computing platforms takes place.

A policy-based mechanism helps in activating these channels based on present environmental conditions. Such
policy-driven approaches let the system adapt to changes in the environment dynamically and ensure data movement
operates optimally even under changing conditions.

Prioritizing data across these channels can provide a mechanism to decrease the impact of Network storms upon
re-connection. Network storms typically refer to a surge in network traffic, which can cause delays or disruptions. By
prioritizing data, the system can manage the amount of data being transferred upon re-connection, thus minimizing the
potential effect of a network storm.

Handling data synchronization between clouds needs a robust strategy that can dynamically adapt to
environmental conditions and manage data movement without causing disruptions in network connectivity. This strategy
relies on using differential channels, policy-driven mechanisms, and prioritizing data to minimize network storms at
re-connection times.

## Data Priorization within Channels

Data prioritization within channels signifies the process of ordering and grading the importance of data as it moves
through various communication avenues or channels, based on pre-defined policies.

Channel policies are guidelines or procedures that determine how data is handled, processed, and prioritized within each
channel. These policies are crucial for maintaining orderly data flow and prevent data congestion that can affect the
efficiency of the system.

The Channel Manager plays a significant role in controlling the data flow across various channels for each data stream.
It ensures that data is well-conducted and monitored according to the set policies, to assure optimal distribution and
processing.

Adopting a policy-driven approach towards prioritizing data based on channels and streams provides an effective
mechanism to manage massive amounts of data efficiently. It keeps the data flow structured and the channels
well-distributed, enhancing the overall operational efficiency and accuracy of data transmission and processing.

Data prioritization within channels, managed by the Channel Manager and directed by channel policies, is a vital
component of effectual data management and processing. It ensures system effectiveness by organizing transmission and
optimizing the data flow across multiple channels and streams so that it meets projected outcomes.

## Policy Driven Channel Management

Policy-driven channel management is an approach where strategic policies guide the creation, activation, and data
prioritization mechanisms in a system's channels.

There are three kinds of SABR (Semi-Autonomous Bi-Directional Replication) policies governing this mechanism. These
include:

1. **Channel Creation Policy**: This shapes how channels are set up within the system.

1. **Channel Activation Policy**: This policy dictates when and how channels will be activated for data transmission.

1. **Data Prioritization Policy**: This policy sets the criteria for determining the order in which data should be
   processed and transferred through the channels.

An essential aspect of these policies is their versatile applicability. They can be applied to individual SABRs, groups
of SABRs, platforms, and even scale up to full deployment levels. This means that regardless of the scope—whether at an
individual device level or a larger networked system—the channel management policies help ensure consistent and
efficient data management.

The concept of policy-driven channel management provides a framework for effective and adaptable data management in
systems like SABR. By defining strategic policies for channel creation, activation, and data prioritization, it's
possible to streamline data flow and significantly improve overall system efficiency.
