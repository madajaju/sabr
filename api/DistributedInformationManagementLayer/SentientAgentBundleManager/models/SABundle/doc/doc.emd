SABundle contains the definition for the SABR. Including the definition of the input and output streams. Any 
transformations and the application, AIModel, for the transformation.

## Application and SABR integration.
The SABR handles input and output data stream management for the application.
The first version of SABR all applications can be written using any language.
Data from the input stream is intercepted by the transforms for the SABR.
Those transformation can communicate with the application using any internal mechanism required. filesystem, 
websocket.io. rest interface etc...
Additionally a transformation can take output from an application and send it to the output streams defined in the 
SABR. This can be done by watching a filesystem, relaying messages from a websocket or other streaming mechanism.
