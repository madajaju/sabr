## Self decrypting repository and launcher

* The image that gets deployed is a self encrypted repo that has all of the images for the SABR to run properly 
  including the stream manager, application images, AI volumes, etc..
* When the SAB image gets created all of the images are already in the registry that was created specifically for 
  the build. Then the /var/lib/registry is encrypted and put into the base docker image. which is a registry image. 
  This has to be the case because there is no connectivity to a central repo when the SAB is deployed. Everything 
  must be self contained.
### Building a SAB
1. Create a temporary volume for the registry (tempreg)
1. <strike>Start a build registry with the volume mounted to /var/lib/registry</Strike> - Not Needed
1. Build all of the images that will be going into the SAB
1. <Strike>Push the images to the build registry</strike>
1. <Strike>stop and remove the build registry</strike>
1. save the images with docker save > image.tar
1. <strike>encrypt the temporary volume for the registry (tmpreg) create one file tmpreg.enc</strike>
1. encrypt the image.tar files
1. Build the SAB image 
   1. SAB image is a combination of <strike>registry</strike>, node:alpine, docker:alpine
   1. Copy tmpreg.enc copied into the SAB image
   1. Copy the init.js script into the SAB image
   1. Copy the package.json into the SAB image
   1. Copy new entrypoint.sh into the SAB image
   1. entrypoint should be changed to entrypoint.sh
1. Save the docker image to a compress tar file with docker save

### Deploying a SAB
1. transfer the docker image to the target device in a *.tar.gz file
1. load the docker image with docker load
1. start the container with the SAB image
   1. Check to see if the device is attested to this SAB
   1. Decrypt the tmpreg.enc
   1. <strike>Start the registry in the background</strike>
   1. load the image.tar files using the docker load command.
   1. call the entrypoint.sh file. This should deploy the images using a swarm or compose file depending on the method.

    
Note: Registry may not be needed to load the images. Using docker save and docker load.
